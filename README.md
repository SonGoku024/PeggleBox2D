# PLAYING THE GAME

## Goal

Peggle is a game where you try to hit 25 orange pegs with 10 metal balls. You have enrolled in the Peggle Institute, and ten Peggle Masters are ready to train you in the skills, wonders and mysteries of Peggle. Your goal is to complete the full course of study at the Peggle Institute and earn the title of Peggle Master.

## The Basics

Peggle is played on a Peggle board. The majority of the board is taken up by an array of pegs. At the top of the board is a Launcher, which you control. You aim the Launcher by moving the mouse cursor, and you fire it by clicking the left mouse button. Firing the Launcher shoots a Peggle ball that bounces around the board lighting up each peg it hits until falling off the bottom of the board. The lit pegs then disappear and you can take another shot.

You begin each level with ten balls. Light up the 25 orange pegs scattered randomly around the board to complete the level and achieve Extreme Fever.

## Controls

The controls for Peggle are simple: move your mouse cursor to the point where you want the ball to go. The Launcher will automatically aim to follow your mouse cursor.

Click the left mouse button to fire a Peggle ball. The ball will head to where the tip of the cursor was when you clicked.

You can hold down the right mouse button any time the ball is not in play to speed up the motion of the Free Ball Bucket and any moving pegs. This is helpful when waiting for moving objects.

You can also use the mouse wheel or the left and right arrow keys to make small angle adjustments. This is useful for getting the exact shot that you want. Hitting the Enter key will fire the ball.

## Pegs

Pegs can be round or rectangular. If rectangular, they are sometimes called bricks.

Pegs come in four colors:

- ** Blue (Standard peg):** These make up the vast majority of the pegs on the board.
Base value: 10 points.
- ** Orange (Goal peg):** There are 25 orange pegs per level, and they must all be lit in order to complete the level.
Base value: 100 points (10x blue).
- ** Purple (Point peg):** The purple peg is worth 50x the value of the blue pegs. There is one purple peg per turn and its location changes every shot. Purple pegs appear for the first time on the fourth level.
Base value: 500 points (50x blue).
- ** Green (Magic peg):** Hitting a green peg activates a Peggle Magic Power, either immediately or on the next shot (see Peggle Masters and Magic Powers, below). There are two green pegs per level. Green pegs appear for the first time on the third level.
Base value: 10 points (1x blue).

## Ball-O-Tron

On the left side of the Peggle board is the Ball-o-Tron. The number at the top of the Ball-o-Tron shows how many balls you have left, and the balls themselves sit in the hopper underneath. You begin each level with 10 balls: 9 in the Ball-o-Tron and one pre-loaded in the Launcher at the top of the screen.

## Fevermeter

On the right side of the Peggle board is the Fevermeter. As you eliminate orange pegs, the Fevemeter lights up. As you hit certain points on the Fevermeter, a score multiplier takes effect that increases the point value of your pegs. For a more detailed description of the score multiplier, see Shot Scores in the Scoring section below.

## Extreme Fever

Hitting the last orange peg on a level completes the level and activates Extreme Fever. The screen zooms in on the ball, time slows down, and the words "Extreme Fever" zestfully appear. You can click the left mouse button to end slow-motion mode and return to normal speed.

Blue and green pegs struck after Fever has been activated earn 1000 points each. Hitting a purple peg after Fever earns 10,000 points.

After activating Fever, the ball will continue on its way until falling into one of five bonus point areas that appear on the bottom of the board; from left to right their values are 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 50,000 and 10,000 points.

## Ultra Extreme Fever

If you clear all the pegs on a level you will activate Ultra Extreme Fever. In that case all the five bonus point areas will award 100,000 points, and you will win a special All Pegs Cleared ribbon for that level. Rumor has it that a secret rank of Peggle Mastery awaits one who can get All Pegs Cleared ribbons for every Peggle board.

# Peggle Masters and Magic Powers

The Masters watch your play from above the Launcher, and each of them has a special Magic Power that is activated when you hit the green peg. Some Magic Powers activate immediately, while others take effect on your next shot. The number above the Peggle Master's head shows how many shots remain on the Magic Power.

### Super Guide

- **Master:** Bjorn Unicorn
- **Effect:** The Super Guide greatly extends the aiming line to show the path the ball will take through one bounce. Note that the ball does not travel in a straight line; instead, its path is curved as a result of the effect of gravity on the ball's motion. Use the Super Guide to get a sense of exactly how you should place your mouse cursor to get a specific shot. Though not as flashy as some of the later Magic Powers, mastering the Super Guide is the foundation of all Peggle skill.
- **Activation:** Takes effect on next shot.
- **Duration:** Three shots.

### Multiball

- **Master:** Jimmy Lightning
- **Effect:** The Multiball Magic Power spawns a second ball from the green peg. If the green peg is hit on the right side then the Multiball will pop out on the left side, and vice versa. Both balls continue to bounce around the board and both contribute to the shot score. Skillful (or lucky) use of the Multiball can add up to big points as well as two chances to land a ball in the Free Ball Bucket.
- **Activation:** Takes effect immediately.
- **Duration:** Lasts the length of the shot.

### Pyramid Power

- **Master:** Kat Tut
- **Effect:** The Pyramid Power adds pyramid-like bumpers to the sides of the Free Ball Bucket. This dramatically increases the chance that a ball will bounce back up into play or fall into the bucket.
- **Activation:** Take effect immediately.
- **Duration:** Five shots, including the activating shot.

### Space Blast

- **Master:** Splork
- **Effect:** The Space Blast creates an explosion that lights up all pegs within slightly more than a four peg-width radius from the green peg. This is useful for clearing whole areas of the board, and you can boost your shot score by waiting until you can catch the purple peg in a Space Blast.
- **Activation:** Takes effect immediately.
- **Duration:** Instant.

### Flippers

- **Master:** Claude Lobster
- **Effect:** Hitting the green peg causes two claw-like Flippers to appear at the lower left and right corners of the board. Flippers are used to pop the ball back up into play. Flip the Flippers by clicking the left mouse button. You can hold the Flippers in the flipped-up position by holding down the left mouse button; this is useful for trapping the ball with the Flippers to set up a good flip.
- **Activation:** Takes effect immediately.
- **Duration:** Three shots, including the activating shot.

### Spooky Ball

- **Master:** Renfield Pumpkin
- **Effect:** When the Spooky Ball is activated the ball will drop out of the bottom of the board and reappear at the top for a second pass through the Peggle board. The Spooky Ball reappears at the same spot at the top as it left the bottom. Any pegs hit on the ball's second pass are added to the shot score. Used skillfully, the Spooky Ball can be one of the most effective point-earning Magic Powers in the game.
- **Activation:** Takes effect immediately. Upon activation the Free Ball Bucket is capped; the cap is removed once the Spooky Ball does its disappearing-reappearing act.
- **Duration:** Lasts the length of the shot.

### Flower Power

- **Master:** Tula Sunflower
- **Effect:** The Flower Power will light up the closest one fifth (rounded up) of the remaining orange pegs whenever the green peg is hit. This is effective at clearing large numbers of orange pegs at once and helps to push up the point multiplier on the Fevermeter. Use the Flower Power early to maximize its effect, or hold off until the end of the level to light up particularly hard-to-reach orange pegs.
- **Activation:** Takes effect immediately.
- **Duration:** Instant.

### Lucky Spin

- **Master:** Warren Rabbit
- **Effect:** Hitting the green peg drops down the Lucky Spin wheel and gives it a spin. The wheel has four outcomes: Free Ball, Triple Score, Magic Hat and a randomly chosen Magic Power.
If the spinner lands on Free Ball, you are awarded a Free Ball.
If the spinner lands on Triple Score, then the shot score will be tripled at the end of the shot, and the next shot will also have its shot score tripled.
If the spinner lands on the Magic Hat, then the ball instantly acquires a top hat that bounces with the ball and lights up any pegs that it touches.
If the spinner lands on the random Magic Power, then that power takes effect as it would normally, either instantly or on the next shot.
If you click on the Lucky Spin wheel while the spin is in motion, the spinner will instantly arrive at the spot it was going to reach; this will not necessarily be the spot on the wheel where you clicked.
- **Activation:** Takes effect immediately.
- **Duration:** Variable. Free Balls are awarded instantly. The Triple Score lasts for two shots, including the activating shot. The Magic Hat lasts for two shots, including the activating shot. The randomly chosen Magic Power lasts for as long as it normally would.

### Fireball

- **Master:** Lord Cinderbottom
- **Effect:** When the Fireball is activated, the Peggle ball is replaced by a large burning sphere. The Fireball does not bounce when it hits a peg; instead it burns a path through the board, lighting up and instantly eliminating any pegs it touches. The Free Ball Bucket is capped while the Fireball is active, allowing you to bounce the Fireball off it to hit more pegs. The Free Ball Bucket cap disappears if the Fireball hits it.
- **Activation:** Takes effect on the next shot.
- **Duration:** Lasts for one shot.

### Zen Ball

- **Master:** Master Hu
- **Effect:** When the Zen Ball is activated, Master Hu will consider a range of possible paths the ball could take on that shot and will nudge the ball to select the highest-scoring path, with additional weighting on dropping the ball in the Free Ball Bucket and lighting up orange pegs. Once you take the shot, Zen Ball will tell you how much it has improved your shot. "No improvement" means Zen Ball has not improved your shot. "Zen achieved" means your shot has been improved (by dropping the ball in the Free Ball Bucket, for instance) but not for additional points. "(Some Percentage) More Zen" means that your shot has been improved by the given percentage. "Maximum Zen" means your shot has been improved by more than 500% over the original shot.
- **Activation:** Takes effect on the next shot.
- **Duration:** Lasts one shot.

## Style Shots

Certain kinds of cool shots will earn special recognition and bonus points. These bonus points add to your overall level score but do not add directly to your shot score (and thus do not help in earning a Free Ball).
